# Bucket-Sort
The collection is distributed into buckets in order to perform the sorting. Algorithms are executed one at a time, or recursively executing the bucket sorting algorithm It classifies data in the short to most-to-least important digit and the general category. This can be done with contrasts, and hence is an algorithm for sorts. The computational complexity depends on the algorithm, the number of algorithms, and whether the data is uniformly distributed.
